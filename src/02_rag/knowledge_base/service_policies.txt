**Customer Service Policies and Guarantees**

**Installation Appointments:**
We guarantee that a technician will arrive within the scheduled 4-hour appointment window. If our technician fails to arrive within the scheduled window, you are entitled to a one-time credit of $20 on your next bill. Please contact customer support to report a missed appointment.

**Service Outage Guarantee:**
We strive for 99.9% network uptime. If you experience a continuous service outage for more than 24 hours, you may be eligible for a pro-rated credit for the days you were without service. This does not apply to outages caused by customer equipment or planned network maintenance.

**Customer Support Commitment:**
Our goal is to resolve your issues on the first contact. We are committed to providing professional, empathetic, and effective support. If you are not satisfied with the support you received, you can ask to speak to a supervisor at any time.
