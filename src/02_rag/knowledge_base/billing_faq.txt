**Frequently Asked Questions about Billing**

**Q: Why was I overcharged on my last bill?**
A: An overcharge can happen for a few reasons. The most common are: promotional period ending, charges for one-time services like movie rentals, or changes in your service package. Please check the detailed breakdown on your statement. If you still believe there is an error, contact our support team with your account number.

**Q: How can I change my payment method?**
A: You can update your payment method at any time through our online customer portal. Log in to your account, navigate to the "Billing" section, and select "Manage Payment Methods."

**Q: What happens if I miss a payment?**
A: A late fee may be applied to your account if a payment is not received by the due date. Continued failure to pay may result in a temporary suspension of your services. We recommend setting up AutoPay to avoid missed payments.
