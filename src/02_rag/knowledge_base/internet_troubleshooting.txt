**Troubleshooting Common Internet Issues**

**1. No Internet Connection**
- **Check the Modem/Router Lights:** Ensure the power, receive, send, and online lights are solid green. If any are blinking or off, unplug the device for 60 seconds and plug it back in.
- **Restart Your Device:** Sometimes the issue is with your computer or phone. Try restarting it.
- **Check Cables:** Make sure all cables are securely connected to your devices and wall outlets. An ethernet cable should click into place.

**2. Slow Internet Speeds**
- **Run a Speed Test:** Use a reliable speed test website to check your current download and upload speeds. Compare this to the plan you are paying for.
- **Move Closer to the Router:** If you are on Wi-Fi, your distance from the router can significantly impact speed. Try moving closer.
- **Disconnect Unused Devices:** Too many devices connected to your Wi-Fi at once can slow down the network. Disconnect any that are not in use.
- **Restart Your Router:** Just like with a lost connection, restarting your router can often resolve speed issues.
