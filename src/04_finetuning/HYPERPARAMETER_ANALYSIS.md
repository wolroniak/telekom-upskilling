# Hyperparameter Sweep Analysis Guide

By running the `run_hyperparameter_sweep.py` script, a new directory is created: `models/hyperparameter_sweep/`.

```bash
tensorboard --logdir models/hyperparameter_sweep
```

This will start the TensorBoard server. Access it by opening the provided URL (`http://localhost:6006/`).
