The most common are: promotional period ending, charges for one-time services like movie rentals, or changes in your service package. Please check the detailed breakdown on your statement. If you still believe there is an error, contact our support team with your account number.\n\n**Q: How can I change my payment method?**\nA: You can update your payment method at any time through our online customer portal. Log in to your account, navigate to the \"Billing\" section, and select \"Manage Payment Methods.\"\n\n**Q: What happens if I miss a payment?**\nA: A late fee may be applied to your account if a payment is not received by the due date. Continued failure to pay may result in a temporary suspension of your services. We recommend setting up AutoPay to avoid missed payments.\n\n---\n\n**Customer Service Policies and Guarantees**\n\n**Installation Appointments:**\nWe guarantee that a technician will arrive within the scheduled 4-hour appointment window.

If you still can’t get online, move on to our internet signal troubleshooting section to solve the problem.\n\nCheck for an internet outage\nIt could be that you’re not the only one whose internet is down. You can find information about internet outages on the website Down Detector, or you can contact your internet service provider (ISP) to investigate.\n\nThe site or service you’re trying to access could also be down. Try a few different websites. If they load properly, the original website you went to could be down for all visitors.

Whether you’re hooked up to Wi-Fi but without internet access or you’re having trouble with a wired Ethernet connection, we’ll show you the quickest methods to identify the problem and get back online.\n\nWhen it comes to internet troubleshooting, you can either methodically work your way through the troubleshooting steps or just start trying fixes until something works.

The most common are: promotional period ending, charges for one-time services like movie rentals, or changes in your service package. Please check the detailed breakdown on your statement. If you still believe there is an error, contact our support team with your account number.\n\n**Q: How can I change my payment method?**\nA: You can update your payment method at any time through our online customer portal. Log in to your account, navigate to the \"Billing\" section, and select \"Manage Payment Methods.\"\n\n**Q: What happens if I miss a payment?**\nA: A late fee may be applied to your account if a payment is not received by the due date. Continued failure to pay may result in a temporary suspension of your services.

Compare this to the plan you are paying for.\n- **Move Closer to the Router:** If you are on Wi-Fi, your distance from the router can significantly impact speed. Try moving closer.\n- **Disconnect Unused Devices:** Too many devices connected to your Wi-Fi at once can slow down the network. Disconnect any that are not in use.\n- **Restart Your Router:** Just like with a lost connection, restarting your router can often resolve speed issues.\n\n---\n\nIs the problem with your internet signal or your Wi-Fi?\nInternet signal issues have different fixes than Wi-Fi issues—so, it’s important to find out which you’re dealing with. Examples of internet signal issues include problems with the signal coming from your ISP, modem issues, and issues with the wiring in and around your home. Wi-Fi issues are problems with your router’s wireless signal, such as interference from obstructions, too much distance between the router and devices, or interference from other networks and electronics.\n\nYou can tell an internet signal issue from a Wi-Fi issue with a few key troubleshooting steps.\n\n---\n\n5.
