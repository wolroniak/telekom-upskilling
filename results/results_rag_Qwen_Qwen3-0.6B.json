If the context does not seem relevant, state that you do not have enough information to answer the question based on your knowledge base.\n\n**Provided Context:**\n**Frequently Asked Questions about Billing**\n\n**Q: Why was I overcharged on my last bill?**\nA: An overcharge can happen for a few reasons. The most common are: promotional period ending, charges for one-time services like movie rentals, or changes in your service package. Please check the detailed breakdown on your statement. If you still believe there is an error, contact our support team with your account number.\n\n**Q: How can I change my payment method?**\nA: You can update your payment method at any time through our online customer portal. Log in to your account, navigate to the \"Billing\" section, and select \"Manage Payment Methods.\"\n\n**Q: What happens if I miss a payment?**\nA: A late fee may be applied to your account if a payment is not received by the due date. Continued failure to pay may result in a temporary suspension of your services. We recommend setting up AutoPay to avoid missed payments.\n\n---\n\n**Customer Service Policies and Guarantees**\n\n**Installation Appointments:**\nWe guarantee that a technician will arrive within the scheduled 4-hour appointment window. If our technician fails to arrive within the scheduled window, you are entitled to a one-time credit of $20 on your next bill. Please contact customer support to report a missed appointment.\n\n**Service Outage Guarantee:**\nWe strive for 99.9% network uptime. If you experience a continuous service outage for more than 24 hours, you may be eligible for a pro-rated credit for the days you were without service. This does not apply to outages caused by customer equipment or planned network maintenance.\n\n**Customer Support Commitment:**\nOur goal is to resolve your issues on the first contact. We are committed to providing professional, empathetic, and effective support. If you are not satisfied with the support you received, you can ask to speak to a supervisor at any time.\n\n---\n\nAlso, check for damage. See if the cable looks torn or perhaps chewed by a pet.

If you still don’t have internet, the problem is likely bigger than your Wi-Fi, but it might still just be your device. Try accessing the web on a different device. If you still can’t get online, move on to our internet signal troubleshooting section to solve the problem.\n\nCheck for an internet outage\nIt could be that you’re not the only one whose internet is down. You can find information about internet outages on the website Down Detector, or you can contact your internet service provider (ISP) to investigate.\n\nThe site or service you’re trying to access could also be down. Try a few different websites. If they load properly, the original website you went to could be down for all visitors. (You can confirm this by typing in the URL at downforeveryoneorjustme.com.)\n\nPro tip:\n\n---\n\nIt’s incredibly frustrating when your internet isn’t working. Whether you’re hooked up to Wi-Fi but without internet access or you’re having trouble with a wired Ethernet connection, we’ll show you the quickest methods to identify the problem and get back online.\n\nWhen it comes to internet troubleshooting, you can either methodically work your way through the troubleshooting steps or just start trying fixes until something works. While methodical troubleshooting is better for getting to the bottom of an issue once and for all, sometimes you just need to get back online ASAP. We’ll start with our top five internet quick fixes and then walk you through a more thorough troubleshooting process if you’re still having issues.\n\nIn this guide:\n\nTop 5 quick fixes for internet issues | Is it your internet signal or your Wi-Fi? | Connected to Wi-Fi but no internet access | Wi-Fi troubleshooting | Advanced troubleshooting | Complete list of internet fixes\n\n---\n\n5.

The most common are: promotional period ending, charges for one-time services like movie rentals, or changes in your service package. Please check the detailed breakdown on your statement. If you still believe there is an error, contact our support team with your account number.\n\n**Q: How can I change my payment method?**\nA: You can update your payment method at any time through our online customer portal. Log in to your account, navigate to the \"Billing\" section, and select \"Manage Payment Methods.\"\n\n**Q: What happens if I miss a payment?**\nA: A late fee may be applied to your account if a payment is not received by the due date. Continued failure to pay may result in a temporary suspension of your services. We recommend setting up AutoPay to avoid missed payments.\n\n---\n\n**Customer Service Policies and Guarantees**\n\n**Installation Appointments:**\nWe guarantee that a technician will arrive within the scheduled 4-hour appointment window.

Compare this to the plan you are paying for.\n- **Move Closer to the Router:** If you are on Wi-Fi, your distance from the router can significantly impact speed. Try moving closer.\n- **Disconnect Unused Devices:** Too many devices connected to your Wi-Fi at once can slow down the network. Disconnect any that are not in use.\n- **Restart Your Router:** Just like with a lost connection, restarting your router can often resolve speed issues.\n\n---\n\nIs the problem with your internet signal or your Wi-Fi?\nInternet signal issues have different fixes than Wi-Fi issues—so, it’s important to find out which you’re dealing with. Examples of internet signal issues include problems with the signal coming from your ISP, modem issues, and issues with the wiring in and around your home. Wi-Fi issues are problems with your router’s wireless signal, such as interference from obstructions, too much distance between the router and devices, or interference from other networks and electronics.\n\nYou can tell an internet signal issue from a Wi-Fi issue with a few key troubleshooting steps.\n\n---\n\n5.

If your IP address looks like this, it means that Windows couldn’t get an IP address from your router. If you’re not using static IP addresses on your network, then check to make sure DHCP is enabled on your router. Check the documentation for your router to find out how to do this. If this fixes your Wi-Fi problem, the No connection icon will change to Wi-Fi connected in a few seconds.\n\n​​​​​​​Check your DNS server.

Labels for Wi-Fi lights vary but usually will read “2.4G” and “5G,” “WLAN,” or “Wireless.” These lights should be on and are usually blinking. If the Wi-Fi light(s) are off or red, your router isn’t broadcasting a signal.
